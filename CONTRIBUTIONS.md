# CONTRIBUTIONS

This project has been realized by **Florentin Bekier and Rémi Blaise**. We proceeded in the following way:

1) A first version of the Design Document specifying all the necessary changes between PA3 and PA4 has been written jointly. The RSA algorithm was studied jointly to design our implementation.
2) The RSA algorithm was implemented by Florentin Bekier while the integration of the algorithm into our existing project was by Rémi Blaise.
3) The Evaluation and Measurement of the project was carried out by Rémi Blaise.
4) The Design Document, Manual and Contributions Document have been written by Florentin Bekier while the Verification Document have been by Rémi Blaise.
